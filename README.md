# freeCodeCamp Scientific Computing Python Projects

Welcome to my repository for the **freeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python Projects**! This repo showcases the projects I built while completing the **Scientific Computing with Python Certification**. Each project demonstrates my skills in Python programming, problem-solving, and computational thinking.

## Projects Included

1. **Arithmetic Formatter**  
   - **Description**: A program to format and display arithmetic problems in a structured manner. Useful for presenting and verifying simple addition and subtraction problems.
   - **Skills Used**: String manipulation, error handling.

2. **Time Calculator**  
   - **Description**: A program to calculate the end time after a certain duration is added to a starting time. Includes support for AM/PM format and optional weekday calculation.
   - **Skills Used**: Date and time calculations, logic implementation.

3. **Budget App**  
   - **Description**: A simple budgeting application to manage categories, track deposits and withdrawals, and visualize spending with a bar chart.
   - **Skills Used**: Object-oriented programming (OOP), visualization.

4. **Polygon Area Calculator**  
   - **Description**: A program to calculate the area and perimeter of rectangles and squares using Python classes.
   - **Skills Used**: OOP, inheritance, geometric calculations.

5. **Probability Calculator**  
   - **Description**: A program to simulate random drawing of colored balls from a hat and estimate the probability of a desired outcome.
   - **Skills Used**: Probability, random module, simulations.
